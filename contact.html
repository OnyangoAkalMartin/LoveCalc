<p>My name is Martin Akal and I was born on the 7th of August, 1999 in Nyatike, Migori. My parents are Voster  Akal  and Everline John . I attended Holy Family Catholic School in Migori town from kindergarten until sixth grade.  <br>
    While there I participated in band, choir, Boy Scouts, Council of Catholic Boys, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards.  <br>
    In seventh and eighth grade I attended St. Michael Junior Academy. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every term, and received the presidential academic award.
    <br>
    My High School was attended at Agengâ€™a  High School . While there I was a students leader . I was also involved in games, Hockey. I then merited in my final exam (KCSE) to proceed to college and achieve my life time dream carrer.   <br>
    I currently attend UMMA University, pursuing Bachelors of Science in Computer Science majoring on Software Engineering.  I am involved in Red Cross  club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. <br>
    I have am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in myl career. I received my academic and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. <br>
     Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others.  <br>
    I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. <br>
